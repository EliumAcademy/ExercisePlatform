#### Self Unmount

Create a component called Counter that once it reaches 3 it will display a series of messages: 
- Component will unmount in 3
- Component will unmount in 2
- Component will unmount in 1
- Component will unmount in 0
when it reaches 0 the component should unmount itself. Use setInterval instead of setTimeout.
