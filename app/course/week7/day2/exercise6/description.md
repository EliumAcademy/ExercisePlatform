#### Delete on hover


Create a component called ShowInLIst that displays a list of elements ad in example but also if a user hovers on one of the elements, that element will be removed.

**Example:**

```jsx
<ShowList list ={[1,2,3,4]}/>
//displays
<ul>
    <li>1</li>
    <li>2</li>
    <li>3</li>
    <li>4</li>
</ul>
```
