#### Submit Detail


Modify Exercise 4 by adding a submit button so that the info will only be updated when the submit button is clicked. Notes: the function that is called once the event is triggered (effectively a callback) will recieve one single argument with info about the event that took place. The event.target will point to the element from which the event originated.

**Notes:**
1. Use a button tag and bind the event to an on click event on the button
1. Remember that the event.target will point to the element from which the event originated.
