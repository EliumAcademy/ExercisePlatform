#### Validating form

Extend the previous exercise by adding “form-checking” to your input form.  If the submit button is pressed without any value, or a value of incorrect format, an alert should open with the message: ```Correct format is "first name + space + surname".```. Any name that breaks that patter should generate an allert.

**Attention:** to make the exercise withoug problems wrap your solutions withing a div with ```id = 'myExerciseSolutions'``` and wrap all your html withing that div. Also all your jquery DOM searches & manipulation should be relative to that div!
