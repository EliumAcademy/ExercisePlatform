#### Statefull Render


Create a react component Profile (Statefull component) that can be used as in the example and; together with 3 other components that you need to create: Name, Email and Address; display the information shown in the example.

**Example:**

```jsx
<Profile>
    <Name/>
    <Email/>
    <Address/>
</Profile>


// displays:
<div>
    <div> Name: Pedro </div>
    <div> Email: pedro@pedro.pedro </div>
    <div> Address: PedroStraat 21, 3000 Pedroland </div>
</div>
```

**Notes:** You don't need to import any script or render the component. the React class is already avaliable withing the platform.
