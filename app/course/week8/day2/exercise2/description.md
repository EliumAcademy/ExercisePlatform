#### Shorter names

We just realice that we donâ€™t need to see the full surname in the table; extend the previous exercise 1 to only display the initial of the last name, but while the user hovers on the initial, the full name should be displayed. 

**Notes:**
1. Use an onMouseEnter event
2. at any time ```tr``` elements should only contain the text that is visible
3. We do not test if the text will be changed on hover, there are may ways in which that can be accomplish, we trust you will make it happen anyhow ;)
4. this time you will have to mount the components like we did yesterday. If you want to view your own app mount it at the following DOM Node: ```document.getElementById("yourSolution"))```. Instead you **must** mount it at the following DOM Node to get your component tested: ```document.getElementsByClassName("jasmine-testground")[0]```.
