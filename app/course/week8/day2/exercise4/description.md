#### Validating form

Extend the previous exercise by adding “form-checking” to your input form.  If the submit button is pressed without any value, or a value of incorrect format, an alert should open with the message: ```Correct format is "first name + space + surname".```. Any name that breaks that patter should generate an allert.

**Notes:** You **must** mount it at the following DOM Node to get your component tested: ```document.getElementsByClassName("jasmine-testground")[0]```.
