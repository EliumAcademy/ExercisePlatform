#### Jumping Component

**Attention:** This exercise is fun but it is quite hard; You can move on to tomorrow exercises in you would like to have something simpler!

Create a react component that manages an other react component. The second react component should be made jump when the first compoenent is clicked. You can use the css shown here to style your component.


```css
    .game {
        display: inline-block;
        background-color: red;
        width: 500px;
        height: 200px;
        position: relative;
        border-bottom: 2px solid black
    }

    .jumping-box {
        display: inline-block;
        background-color: green;
        position: absolute;
        bottom: 0px;
        left: 250px;
        width: 25px;
        height: 25px;
    }

```

This Styling is already presend in the document so no extra should be needed
