Elium is expanding, and we are adding new bootcamps. Now we have Java, Node, PHP & C++.  Add an input field to your form which allows a student to specify the course they are enrolled in. A student can be entered multiple times (for different classes). Display 4 different classlists  with the name of the class at the top of each list as in the example. Also, Make a button that will show a list of all the students with no duplicate names in a separate table.
