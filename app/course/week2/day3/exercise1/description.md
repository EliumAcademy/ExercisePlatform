#### Elium App

Build a simple app for Elium.  It is just a form with a single input field in which the end-user can add the full name of a student as “first name +surname”.  Once submit is pressed, the new name and surname gets added to a list that is displayed below. The list must be a table with two columns: one column for first name and one for surname.

**Notes:**
1. to succeffully complete the test use an ```input``` filed with ```type="submit"``` and not a button tag
2. In you might need to look into even.preventDefault()
3. Use a bootstrap table

**Attention:** to make the exercise withoug problems wrap your solutions withing a div with ```id = 'myExerciseSolutions'``` and wrap all your html withing that div. Also all your jquery DOM searches & manipulation should be relative to that div!
