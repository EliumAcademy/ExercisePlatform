#### Double check

Extend the previous exercise by making sure that the first letter of the first name and surname are capitals, even if the user inputs a lowercase by mistake.

**Attention:** to make the exercise withoug problems wrap your solutions withing a div with ```id = 'myExerciseSolutions'``` and wrap all your html withing that div. Also all your jquery DOM searches & manipulation should be relative to that div!
