### Operations

Write two functions, one called ```sum``` and an other one called ```subtract``` that respectively sum or subtract two numbers (the two arguments given to the function). For example: here we define two functions a multiplication and division function.

**Exercise:**

```jsx
var multiply = function (a, b) {
    return a * b
}

var divide = function (a, b) {
    return a / b
}
```
