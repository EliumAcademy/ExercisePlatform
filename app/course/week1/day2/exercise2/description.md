### Operations

Write two functions, one called ```sum``` and an other called ```subtract``` that accordingly sum or subtract two numbers that are the two arguments given to the functions. For example here we define two functions a multiplication and division function.

**Exercise:**

```jsx
var multiply = function (a, b) {
    return a * b
}

var divide = function (a, b) {
    return a / b
}
```
