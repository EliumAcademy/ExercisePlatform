### sort

Write a function called ```sort``` that sorts the values of an object, which should all be numbers, from the smaller to the bigger one. The function will return an object with keys going from 0 to n; where n is the number of properties of the object minus 1.
Example:

```jsx
obj = {a: "a", b: "p", c: "c", d: "a", f: "d"}
sort(obj) // {0: "a", 1: "a", 2: "c", 3: "d", 4: "p"}
```
