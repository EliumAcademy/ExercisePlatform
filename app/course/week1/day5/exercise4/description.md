### Factorial

Write a function called ```factorial``` to calculate the factorial of a number.
Example:

```jsx
factorial(5) // 120
```

Notes: In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120. Checkout the [wikipedi article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)
