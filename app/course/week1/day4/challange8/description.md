### Cypher

Build a cypher. Assuming that you can use all letters in the alphabet, only lowercase characters, point commas and question marks, build a cypher that turns readable text into unreadable coded text and then back to your original readable text.

Example:

```jsx
var sample = "hello class, how are you? this text is going to be encrypted in few seconds"


encrypt(sample); // "85==#Q3=1&&:Q8#_Q1^5Q<#(GQ*89&Q*5+*Q9&Q7#9@7Q*#Q25Q5@3^9$*54Q9@Q65_Q&53#@4&"


decrypt(sample ); // "hello class, how are you? this text is going to be encrypted in few seconds"
```
